Hi, I'm @trapersky and I'm currently on my path to becoming a developer. After learning the basics of C++, I am currently working with C#.

Most likely here will be some basic applications and games, mostly from the Head First book. I hope this will change one day!

I have been a gamer my whole life: board, tabletop, PnP and computer games all included - so you can easily guess my biggest area of interest :)
